## Sand (contrast)

This is intended as a "calm" theme with enough contrast to make it immediately clear where short-lived focus currently is. It's primarily contextually contrasted sand/dark reds for main stretches of UI, with blues for areas that see manipulation. Focus is forced using the most obvious of greens.
