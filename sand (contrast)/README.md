# Sand (contrast)

This is intended as a "calm" theme with enough contrast to make it immediately clear where short-lived focus currently is. It's primarily contextually contrasted sand/dark reds for main stretches of UI, with blues for areas that see manipulation. Focus is forced using the most obvious of greens.

I'd have liked to make this super green, too, but that messed with some other elements.
